STEPS TO SET UP GIT IN YOUR COMPUTER AND PUSH CODE TO YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY

->install git
->set git in system variables
->To make a secure connection between local to github repo we need to generate SSH private/public keys
->go to project path and generate keys using "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<github-email>"" 
-> press enter until the process is completed if you dont want to give any password. After this process you will have a key generated and kept in a file  
   and stored in some location in your computer.
-> to copy the key use command "Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard". This will copy the key to the clipboard.
->after this login to your github account,go to profile->settings->ssh keys and then click on add ssh key
->paste the key which is copied previoulsy in the clipboard and give the key a name and add the key.
->now you can connect to your github account and push code.
